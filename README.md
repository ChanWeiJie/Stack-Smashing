# Stack-Smashing
This repository contains code that was written for a Computer Security Module.
The challenges are as follows:
1. Buffer overflow attack
2. Format String attack
3. Return Oriented Programming

## Files
In each sub folder contains an "attack.py" which shows the exploit made to expose the weakness of the corresponding c file.

I have also included a writeup that documented my thought process and picutres showing the success of each attacks.
